{"name":"Hilda-B-.-Mendoza","tagline":"","body":" \r\nI really like how Science and Engineering can come together can create amazing things!I am also interested in Computer Science. I didn't know how amazing it was until I was exposed to it during Girls Who Code, which has been one of the best experiences of my life so far. In the future, I would love to use technology to help others and make an even better world! I am looking forward to learn everyday new things and get out of my confort zone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n My favorite project with Girls Who Code is the MP3 player created in scratch because it was so much fun to write the pseudo and the actual code with my partner, Katia. She and I practically did't stop working on the project and making it even better until we run out of time! It was very exciting on how imagination and creativity is the key part on finishing designing a project.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
